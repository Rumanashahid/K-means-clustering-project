# K-means-clustering-project
Apply K-Means clustering to analyze and group data into meaningful clusters. The project includes dataset selection, exploratory data analysis, cluster visualization, and interpretation of clustering results.
###  K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation
## Objective:
The goal of this project was to segment customers based on their Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score using the K-Means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised learning technique.

### Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned, and numerical features were standardized to prepare for clustering.
###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations like histograms, pairplots, and boxplots helped in understanding the distributions and relationships among features.
###  K-Means Clustering:
Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K = 3).
Applied K-Means to categorize customers into 3 clusters based on their behaviors and attributes.
###  Cluster Analysis: Visualized clusters and interpreted the segmentation based on the distinct grouping of customers in terms of their income and spending patterns.
Findings:

### Cluster 1: Low income, low spending.
### Cluster 2: High income, high spending (potential premium customers).
### Cluster 3: Moderate income, variable spending.
###  Conclusion:
K-Means clustering provided valuable insights for customer segmentation, helping identify distinct customer groups. This segmentation can guide targeted marketing strategies and customer relationship management.
